# This works by looking at exisiting permissions on important directories and cloning
# those permissions down to items under them. The plugins, themes, uploads, and root
# directories are automatically included in this list. If you want to add additional
# "example" directories, include them here. Items under these directories will have
# their permissions set similarly to the directory added.

# Condigure notification behabiors.
notification:
    # Configure notifications via blog posts.

        # Define the blog that updates will be posted to. This will be the internal
        # site identifier, ie: the subdomain of the blog, without the base domain name.
