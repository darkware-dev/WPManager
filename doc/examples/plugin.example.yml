# Normally, this file should be placed into a directory named "plugins" under the same
# directory as the policy file. The contents will match all the options that are available
# for a single block under the 'items' list in the plugin configuration. There is no need
# to provide the plugin slug name, as that will be determined by the filename. In order
# for the file to be loaded properly, it must be named [slug].yml
